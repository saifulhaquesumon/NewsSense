üß† AI News Intelligence Agent ‚Äì ‚ÄúNewsSense‚Äù
NewsSense is a multi-agent system designed to help users track, verify, and summarize breaking news from across the web. It uses a controller agent to understand user intent and route tasks to specialized agents for efficient handling.

üó∫Ô∏è System Diagram & Flow
The user interacts with the Conversation Agent, which acts as a controller. Based on the user's query, it decides which specialist agent to invoke.

 All agent actions and decisions are logged via Logfire.
 All tool inputs are validated using Pydantic schemas.
ü§ñ Agent Roles
Conversation Agent (Controller)

Purpose: Acts as the primary user interface and router.

Logic: Uses the OpenAI gpt-4o model with a tool_choice parameter to analyze the user's query and select the most appropriate tool (get_trending_news, fact_check_claim, or summarize_news).

Entry Point: The run_news_sense(user_query) function.

Trending News Agent

Purpose: To find and report on trending news topics.

Tool: get_trending_news(topic: str)

Implementation: Simulates fetching headlines from a dummy database for categories like 'AI', 'tech', etc.

Fact Checker Agent

Purpose: To verify specific factual claims.

Tool: fact_check_claim(claim: str)

Implementation: Simulates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by checking the user's claim against a predefined knowledge base.

News Summarizer Agent

Purpose: To condense long articles into concise summaries.

Tool: summarize_news(article_text: str)

Implementation: Simulates an extractive summarization model by providing a pre-written, bullet-point summary.

‚úÖ Key Features Implemented
Multi-Agent Routing: The Conversation Agent intelligently routes tasks to specialist agents using OpenAI's function calling feature.

Logfire Integration: All major operations, from receiving a query to executing a tool, are logged using logfire.instrument and logfire.info for observability.

Pydantic Validation: Agent tool inputs are defined with Pydantic models (TrendingNewsInput, FactCheckInput, SummarizeInput) to ensure type safety and data integrity before execution.

Simulated Tools: The project uses dummy functions to simulate complex backend operations like web search, RAG, and summarization, allowing for a focus on the agentic architecture.

Modular Code: The code is organized into logical blocks for configuration, schema definitions, tool implementations, and the main controller, making it easy to understand and extend.
